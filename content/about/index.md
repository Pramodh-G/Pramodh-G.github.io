A little bit about myself.

I'm Pramodh, and I like to create things. I'm `learned_fool` on a lot of online platforms. I made that up in middle school, and it has stuck ever since. I did my undergrad in CS from IIT Kanpur.

When it comes to work - I create and design AI software systems. Currently, I build and evaluate RAG systems @ [Cohesity](https://www.cohesity.com/). Previously - I've been a research assistant at [University of Montreal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/) and [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) working on topics like Optimization, Poisoning and Adversarial attacks in ML.

In my free time, I'm usually:

- exploring places, clicking photos for posterity.
- tucked in my bed, reading a book and listening to music.
- playing carnatic music on the mandolin or singing(sometimes).
- mucking around with open source code.

So if you're in the bay area, and you want to go out for a photo walk - hmu!
