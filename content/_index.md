Hey there!

Recently, I had the urge to share the photographs that I take on a regular basis. Given my permanent hiatus from Instagram - posting a story would mean replying to DMs, which would negate me quitting the app. It also felt like I was shoving content down throats by posting, rather than finding like minded people. So here I am, using `hugo` with my own little custom theme for displaying/explaining the photos I take.

A secondary reason is to write about things I think are cool enough to warrant a place here - music, movies, travel, philosophy - and code. I think it'd be amusing if I look back on my posts 5 years down the line and cringe at them - a definite sign of personality development.

So given this backstory, its kinda cool that you came searching for this corner of the internet - intentionally or unintentionally. Some sections are WIP - so you might see haphazardness.

Head on over to the [about](/about) section to know more about me - or the [gallery](/gallery) to see my clicks!
