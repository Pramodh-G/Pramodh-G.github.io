_Excerpt from my journal - Mid 2023_

What I think when life could've been better.

## Mosaic



_They say:_  
They say you're a mosaic of everyone you've loved.  
Well then, I'm a thousand piece puzzle;  
_One whose corners can't be found._  

I've loved a thousand people  
family, friends - their voices far & feeble  
friends turned lovers, lovers turned strangers  
Expectations paving my downfall.

But they have a part of me in them too  
_So I shall love a thousand more._


## Untitled

I can hide behind music and solo dates  
I may plan trips to Japan and Peru  
I might even love being with myself

But when all is said and done,  
I have nothing but an empty house to come back to.  
Its walls echoing the void  
within itself and me.
