I've tried to put up blogs multiple times in the past, only to leave them neglected. I've grown older - I feel like I have more thoughts to share now.

I have no pressure to be consistent - so hopefully that makes the blogs more interesting. I don't want to be too nitpicky on quality, just try and get things out there as a first step.

I draw inspiration for blogging from:
- [Nicholas Carlini](https://nicholas.carlini.com/): Man just does whatever he wants and documents it.
- [Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/): I once read through _every_ blog post of his, and compiled all advice I could find(meta blog post incoming?).
- [Priyadarshi Singh](https://dryairship.github.io/): A cool college senior.
