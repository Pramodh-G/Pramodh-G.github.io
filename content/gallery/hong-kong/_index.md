I've had multiple layovers at Hong Kong - upto 12 hours at a time. What surprises me is how seamlessly it integrates man and nature. It has massive 40 floor apartments built on a hillside, with botanical parks, and beaches right inside. There's good public transport - ferries, trams, subway, buses, bullet trains. To me, it feels more like a living, breathing organism than just lifeless roads and buildings. There's hustle in the city - like Mumbai. Fan Ho - lived and took some of his best photos here.

As with every fast-moving city, blurs effectively capture the kinetic energy in a frame. It tells the story of a city perpetually in motion - the people, the machines, the absurdity of repeating commutes endlessly. Its mind-blowing to me that long exposures turn a still into a self-contained mini-movie - and I had fun messing around with it.
