The mid levels escalator in Hong Kong is the world's longest outdoor, covered escalator system. Literally speaking - these are the arteries of Hong Kong's transport system. It moves life through the city - endlessly, in both directions.

The still man is lost in a moment of contemplation between much motion and chaos. Sometimes, you have to stop and ponder - whats's our destination?
