This picture summarizes much of what my views on religion.

The path to divinity is long and arduous. Some people are content observing from afar, some people make the effort to climb. The closer you get to him, the more you grasp his all-permeating vastness. Whether you are distant or near - he orchestrates all with indifference. When you're immersed in nature, his presence is as undeniable as stone. Yet, he remains as unknowable as a silhouette.
