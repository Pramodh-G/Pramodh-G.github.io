I'm often suprised by how photography exposes who you are.  I think minimalism is one of the core tenets I live life by - and this percolates to all aspects of life, including photography.

It was a relaxed friday afternoon - the light streaming through the blinds. I was resisting the impulse to capture these frames for the past few days - but I gave in to my urges finally. Obviously, taking inspiration from [Fan Ho](https://fanho-forgetmenot.com/a-hong-kong-memoir-1) - I had to do it BNW style.

The mechanical repetitiveness of the blinds. The _slight_ organic tilt of the lamp stand introducing chaos. The stark contrast between light and dark. These stand out to me particularly when I look them.

There is also visual progression throughout these pictures - which is a first for me. The album starts out in slight sepia color, then moves to black and white with _increasing contrast_.

I'll let you draw your own interpretations now :)
