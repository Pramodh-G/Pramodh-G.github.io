It is rightfully named the emerald city - atleast in the summer. People say its a nightmare in winter, with depressing rain and gray skies. It felt like a cheap knock-off of the bay area. The city feels devoid of character - trying to choose between living close to nature and being a tech hub.

The saving grace is nature. Its the closest you can get to Banff without being in Canada. I'll wait for it to change my opinion when I go back.
