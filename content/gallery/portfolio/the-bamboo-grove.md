It was a cold, sunny winter morning in Arashiyama. There was no sign of another soul, the komorebi felt magical. It was just like the windows wallpapers I saw as a kid.


The diffusion makes the leaves lose sharpness - but it also draws more focus more on how the photo _feels_. In this case, it makes me feel that I'm standing under an all encompassing canopy, with light gently hitting my face, the leaves rustling while moving fluidly with the wind.

That's as close as I'll get to touching a canvas.
