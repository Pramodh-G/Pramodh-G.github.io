I was wandering in Hong Kong waiting during my one of my layovers. Even though it had only been 6 hours since I left India, I found myself craving Indian food. After walking through a few shady alleys, I ended up in what I later came to realise was the _Little India_ of Hong Kong. Finishing my dinner, I stepped out to the sight of beautiful post-sunset clouds bathing everything in a purple glow.

Hong Kong felt like a bustling metropolitan city with high rises perched on hill slopes. There's a botanical garden right in the middle of the city. Very walkable. A day spent tanning on the beach, or an evening spent gazing at the sunset from Victoria Peak are both 20 minutes from the center the city. Nature and humanity seem to meld together seamlessly here.

The geometric, rigid patterns of the city blend into the abstract sky, each giving the other enough space to thrive - much like Hong Kong itself.
