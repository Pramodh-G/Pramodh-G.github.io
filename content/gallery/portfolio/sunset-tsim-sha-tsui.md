I'd asked the locals living in Hong Kong's Little India about the best place to see a sunset. I was wandering around aimlessly around HK during my 12 hour layover to the US.

Worried that I was going to miss the sunset, I stumbled upon the promenade only to find everything bathed in pink and purple. This picture, to me captures the essence of HK. Seamlessly blending nature and human occupation.
