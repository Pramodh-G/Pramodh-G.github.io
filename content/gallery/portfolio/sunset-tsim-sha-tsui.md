Even though it had only been 6 hours since I left India, I found myself craving Indian food during a layover in Hong Kong. After walking through a few shady alleys, I ended up in what I later came to realise was the city's vibrant _Little India_. Finishing my dinner, I stepped out to the sight of beautiful post-sunset clouds bathing everything in a purple glow.

This building, caught between day and night, became a perfect metaphor for Hong Kong itself - a city where rigid geometry dissolves into natural beauty, where urban planning bows to mountain slopes, and where a 20-minute journey can take you from a bustling Kowloon to serene beaches. The photograph captures what makes Hong Kong unique: its ability to orchestrate a delicate dance between humanity and nature, each enhancing rather than diminishing the other.
