I'd just walked down the stairs leading to the South Cliff Beach from [Cafe Trip is Life](https://g.co/kgs/eW3kbtK) in Varkala balancing a tres leches in my hand for the second time that week - all to catch a sunset.

The weather forecast had predicted cloudy skies - but nothing to warrant carrying an umbrella. Out of nowhere, it started to drizzle, *while* the sky was orange - with lightning in the far distance out into the sea. Needless to say, I got completely drenched in the rain, clicking hundreds of shots just to capture this one.

Of course, the sea isn't sharp, and the lightning isn't clear - but this will always remind me of a special, one-in-a-million moment.
