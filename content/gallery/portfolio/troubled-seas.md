For the second time that week, I'd carefully descended the stairs from [Cafe Trip is Life](https://g.co/kgs/eW3kbtK), balancing a tres leches in hand, chasing another sunset on the beach.

Out of nowhere, it started to drizzle, *while* the sky was orange - with lightning in the far distance out into the sea. Needless to say, I got completely drenched in the rain, clicking hundreds of shots just to capture this one.

Of course, the sea isn't sharp, and the lightning streak isn't clear, but I got the shot ;)
