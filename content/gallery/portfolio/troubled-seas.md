South Cliff Beach, Varkala. For the second time that week, I'd carefully descended the stairs from [Cafe Trip is Life](https://g.co/kgs/eW3kbtK), balancing a tres leches in hand, chasing another sunset.

The weather forecast had predicted cloudy skies - but nothing to warrant carrying an umbrella. Out of nowhere, it started to drizzle, *while* the sky was orange - with lightning in the far distance out into the sea. Needless to say, I got completely drenched in the rain, clicking hundreds of shots just to capture this one.

Of course, the sea isn't sharp, and the lightning isn't clear, but sometimes imperfection tells the better story - of a rare moment when everything aligns to create magic.
