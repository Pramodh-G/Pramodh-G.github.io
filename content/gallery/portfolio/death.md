It was the last act of Spring, and my final semester at IITK. I'd just started to edit photos on my laptop and I color graded just about every picture I could get my hands on, whether good or bad.

I named this picture _Death_—because spring was ending - college was ending. Fallen bougainvillea leaves, in various stages of decomposition, were eventually returning to the ground, where they originated. The cigarette lighter forms the focal point of the frame—an accessory to death through cigarettes. A single dry leaf catching fire can raze entire forests to the ground. It made me think deeply about transience and how temporary most things are in life.
