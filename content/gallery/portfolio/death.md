_Death_ - captured during the final breaths of spring at IITK. As my college years drew to a close, I found myself obsessively color grading every image I could find, perhaps a subconscious attempt to preserve these fleeting moments.

Fallen bougainvillea leaves - vibrant even in decay, scattered across the earth that will reclaim them. The purple lighter forms the focal point - a slow killer through cigarettes, a potential spark turning these leaves into an inferno. I found myself contemplating the delicate thread between beauty and destruction, between ending and beginning.
