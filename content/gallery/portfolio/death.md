_Death_ - captured during my final semester at IITK. What I particularly like about the photo is that it makes me ruminate on endings - and new beginnings. College was ending. So was the life of these flowers.

However, it is due to these very flowers that new life blooms. I was about to start a new job, in a completely new place. New leaves were cropping up through any gaps they could find.
