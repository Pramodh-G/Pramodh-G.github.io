This was in Kanazawa, Japan. I must confess, the airplane and its contrail was pure luck. However, it did made the photo so much more that what it was supposed to mean. Someone commented that this looked like a 9/11 - and hence the title, _A fake 9/11_.

We as humans do a lot of shenanigans to create a _connected_ world. We fly planes, we raise buildings out of thin air - we demolish them to the ground. We create democracies and hold summits to make ourselves feel large. However, the skies are vast and never-ending - they remind me how small our lives and problems are. Maybe the next time I buy milk at a supermarket - I won't worry too much about whether if its the right kind.
