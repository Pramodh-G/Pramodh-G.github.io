I must confess, the airplane and its contrail was pure luck. Someone commented that this looked like a 9/11 - and hence the title, _A fake 9/11_.

Looking at this makes me realise how big the skies are. Its funny - the airplane that looks so small in the frame probably encloses more people than the building.
