I was heading out to grab a satisfying lunch at Idly Express from my AirBnB. Mini Idlis dipped(read doused) in Sambar.

The owner's cat Olivia, was basking in the warm afternoon sun pouring in through the windows. Contently snoring(purring?) away. Oh to be a cat under the sun. Blue skies, large-as-life clouds and a silent house. It reminded me of simpler times - everyone(including Olivia), enjoying a lazy Sunday.

To acheive a _cozy_ effect - I had to denoise the image so it got a bit blurry, so the viewer can focus on the _vibe_ of the photo. Olivia's fur is a bit fuzzy here(as it often is).
