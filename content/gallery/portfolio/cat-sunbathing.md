The resident cat, Olivia, had claimed her territory on the sun-warmed couch. Oh, to be a cat under the sun. Blue skies, large-as-life clouds and a silent house. It reminded me of simpler times - everyone(including Olivia), enjoying a lazy Sunday.

The intentional softness in the image is to mirror the gentleness of the moment. It makes the photo blurred enough to be dreamy, but sharp enough to evoke the feeling of being there. To me, it captures the essence of the human desire to _slow down, _exist in contentment_ - if only for a moment.
