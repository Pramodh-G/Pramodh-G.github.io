This photo was taken with my _just-received-yesterday_ Fujifilm X100VI camera. I'd hung lights inside my room, and they looked like tiny stars to me.

I've tried to make the lights resemble [star trails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_trail) around Polaris. I wanted to capture the feeling of wanting to sleep under the vast night sky, with its innumerable stars - but from within the coziness and warmth of four walls.

Technically, this used the inbuilt ND filter that came with the camera, and set a 1/4 second exposure. The challenge was manually rotating the camera about the bottom-right corner of the image, with my hands - I didn't want the bed poles to rotate too much. It took *a lot* of tries for the _fake star trails_ to be exactly circular.

I want the viewers to imagine themselves in this space. Even though the bedframe is simple, and the bed is unmade - it contains more than what meets the eye. There is inherent juxtaposition in the image - one of infinity and intimacy.
