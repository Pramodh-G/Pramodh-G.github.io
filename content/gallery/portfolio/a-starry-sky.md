This is one of the first shots I took with my Fujifilm X100VI. I'd just moved to my new apartment, and I was desperately trying to make my room feel like home. The yellow lights were comfy new addition.

With the _LED star trails_, I wanted to capture the feeling of falling asleep under the stars, but from the comfort and familiarity of your own bedroom.
