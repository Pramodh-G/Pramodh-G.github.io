This photo was taken with my _just-received-yesterday_ Fujifilm X100VI camera. I'd hung warm lights inside my room, and they looked like tiny stars to me.

I wanted to capture the feeling of sleeping under the stars - but inside a closed room. I tried to make the lights resemble [star trails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_trail) around the pole star. The amber glow fills me with a sense of comfort, and coziness.

Technically, this used the inbuilt ND filter that came with the camera, and set a 1/4 second exposure. The challenge was manually rotating the camera about the bottom-right corner of the image, with my hands - I didn't want the bed poles to rotate too much. It took *a lot* of tries for the _fake star trails_ to be exactly circular. It does need a bit of perspective correction and shadow lifting, though.

It would have been even cooler to have a human subject sleeping in the bed, but alas :/
