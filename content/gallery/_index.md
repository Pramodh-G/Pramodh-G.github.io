Truth be told, I never thought of photography as something I'd take seriously. It snuck up on me stealthily - I did not put conscious effort into honing my skills until the last semester of college.

It took me 2 years to realise that I _might_ have found myself a new hobby. When I look back, its hard for me to pinpoint a day when I woke up, and told myself - _Yup, you're going to start taking photos now_.

I've split some of what I think are the best clicks I've taken into albums - with descriptions below each image telling you how/why I took the image. I hope that makes it more relatable to you, the viewer - maybe you start looking for these moments in your lives too :)
