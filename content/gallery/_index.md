Truth be told, I never thought of photography as something I'd take seriously. When someone asks me what my hobbies are - I subconsciously leave out photography. Over the last two years, it has taken a shape of its own - I now want to share how I see the world with others.

I started with posting my photos as stories on Insta, but lately I've felt like that isn't the right venue. A caption seems too small to explain my thoughts, and 1:1 ratio feels too constricting to me. Not to mention the image compression. It forces you to be _relevant_ and _trendy_ - the exact opposite of what a hobby is supposed to feel like.

The overarching themes in these photos is _finding beauty in ordinary things_ and _realising how small we are in the grand scheme of the universe_. Optimistic nihilism as I call it. You will most likely [die twice](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9556005-every-man-has-two-deaths-when-he-is-buried-in) in 200 years, might as well live life out the way you want. You don't need grand, main-character moments to define who you are, there's enough moments in our little lives to make our days. A plane in the sky leaving a contrail behind, leaves turning yellow in fall season.

I've split some of what I think are the best clicks I've taken into albums - with descriptions attached to each image telling you how/why I took the image. I hope that makes it more relatable to you, the viewer - maybe you start looking for these moments in your lives too :)
